    <h1>Seximal (Base-6 Numbering System)</h1>
    <p>You're probably familiar with the <a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Hidden/index#decimal">:decimal system.</a></p>
    <p><strong>But</strong>, did you know that there is a <i>better way to count</i>?</p>
    <p>This is the <a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Hidden/index#seximal">:seximal system</a>.</p>
  
    <h1 id="whats-wrong">So, What's Wrong With Decimal?</h1>
    <p>You've probably noticed this, but fractions in decimal are really inconvienent.</p>
    <p>Quick, off the top of your head: what's 1/7th? What's 1/3rd? What's 1/9th?</p>
    <p>You probably couldn't answer the first one, you could answer the second one, and maybe the third one. If you're a nerd.</p>
    <p><a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Hidden/index#danswers">:The answers</a>, by the way.</p>
    <p><a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Hidden/index#sanswers">:Those same fractions</a>, in seximal.</p>

    <p>What's wrong with that? After all, don't we have ten <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger">:finger</a>s?</p>
    <p>But in the decimal system, we don't take advantage of this. We use the whole both hands to display only one digit.</p>
    <p>Most people have two hands, with five fingers each. Why does this matter?</p>
    <p>It's <i>really</i> inefficient. If we treated each finger as a binary bit, we could get up to 2^10 = 1024 on two hands.</p>
    <p>While this may be best for computers, when you need to show a number to someone using your hands, which is the most likely reason to count on your fingers, this can get really confusing.</p>
    <p>So really, think about it. Do we <i>really</i> have ten fingers? Or do we have two hands, of five fingers each?</p>
    <p>With two hands, we have an evolutionarily-gifted setup, perfect for counting of two base six digits, allowing counting all the way up to 35, (or 55 in seximal).</p>
    <p>In fact, the NBA has long used base six for basketball jerseys, with the specific purpose of being easy to show on two hands. They sadly no longer do this.</p>
    
    <h2>Psychology + Numbers</h2>
    <p>Psychology likes the number six.</p>
    <p><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">No, but, for real.</a></p>
    <p>Numbers in base six require 29% (decimal) more digits to express. However, that's a small price to pay for the 40% (decimal) reduction of the amount of digits!</p>
    <p>We also already use base twelve and sixty for timekeeping. (24 hours in a day, 60 seconds in a minute, etc.). If we switched to a seximal system, we would end up with 40 hours in a day, 50 days in a month, and 20 months in a year.</p>

    <h2>An Exercise in Two-Digit Counting</h2>
    <p>Thanks to <a href="https://seximal.net">jan Misali</a>'s terminology, saying two base six digits could never be easier!</p>
    <p>0-20 (0-12 in decimal) all have their normal names.</p>
    <p>2X is "dozen-x." This terminology makes sense because it does.</p>
    <p>3X is thirsy-x, 4X is foursy-x, and 5X is fifsy-x. Then, 100 (36 in decimal) is "nif." Nif is borrowed from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ndom_language">Ndom language</a>.</p>
    <p>Let's do this. Say them out loud!</p>

    <h2>Still not convinced?</h2>
    <p>Computers can easily be based on six-state logic by combining the traditional two-state logic with the not-as-common-but-still-easy three state logic.</p>
    <p>Six is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_composite_number">:hypercomposite</a>. The next hypercomposite is 12, which is just 6*2.</p>
    <p>(If you're wondering, this is the reason fractions are so easy)</p>
    <p>(The other reason is that in any base N, the fractions 1/N-1 and 1/N+1 have very easy repeating decimals.)</p>
    <p><a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Hidden/index#tokipona">:toki pona</a> already has widely accepted unofficial names for the numbers 0-5. (ala, wan, tu, san, po, luka).</p>
    <p>Most currency systems around the world are unevenly spaced. They have a 1 bill, a 10 bill, a 100 bill, etc. but they usually also have in-betweens. A 5 bill, a 50 bill.</p>
    <p>This is because it is inconvienent to count up 10 1-bills before switching denominations. In a base six system, each new denomination is just 6 times the last. 6 is a very manageable number.</p>

    <h2>Multiplication, Memorization, and Magnitude Meaning</h2>
    <p>And here comes the part where I just insert other people's work into my own blog post. <a href="https://www.xanthir.com/b4y30#MemorizationComplexity">:Memorization in Base Six</a>, by its nature, is easier than base ten.</p>
    <p>Because six is smaller than ten, <a href="https://www.xanthir.com/b4y30#OrdersOfMagnitude">:orders of magnitude are easier to deal with in base six.</a></p>
    <p>Actually, go check out <a href="https://www.xanthir.com/b4y30">that page</a>. After this one, of course.</p>

    <h2>What about Imperial?</h2>
    <p>Imperial is based on base twelve, six, and sixteen, so it's actually easier to use in this system. (20 inches in a foot).</p>

    <h2>What about Metric?</h2>
    <p>What about it? <a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Planck/index">:Next blog post?</a></p>
