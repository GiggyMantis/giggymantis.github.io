    <h1>Seximal (Base-6 Numbering System)</h1>
    <p>You're probably familiar with the <a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Hidden/index#decimal">:decimal system.</a></p>
    <p><strong>But</strong>, did you know that there is a <i>better way to count</i>?</p>
    <p>This is the <a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Hidden/index#seximal">:seximal system</a>.</p>
  
    <h1 id="whats-wrong">So, What's Wrong With Decimal?</h1>
    <p>You've probably noticed this, but fractions in decimal are really inconvienent.</p>
    <p>Quick, off the top of your head: what's 1/7th? What's 1/3rd? What's 1/9th?</p>
    <p>You probably couldn't answer the first one, you could answer the second one, and maybe the third one. If you're a nerd.</p>
    <p><a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Hidden/index#danswers">:The answers</a>, by the way.</p>
    <p><a href="https://giggymantis.github.io/Hidden/index#sanswers">:Those same fractions</a>, in seximal.</p>

    <p>What's wrong with that? After all, don't we have ten <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger">:finger</a>s?</p>
    <p>But really, think about it. Do we <i>really</i> have ten fingers? Or do we have two hands, of five fingers each?</p>
    <p>Most people have two hands, with five fingers each. Why does this matter? Using base 10, we treat all ten digits (as in fingers) as one digit (as in numbers)</p>
    <p>That's really inefficient. If we treated each finger as a binary bit, we could get up to 2^10 = 1024 on two hands.</p>
    <p>While this may be best for computers, when you need to show a number to someone using your hands, which is the most likely reason to count on your fingers, this can get really confusing.</p>
    <p>With two hands, we have an evolutionarily-gifted setup, perfect for counting of two base six digits, allowing counting all the way up to 35, (or 55 in seximal).</p>

    <h2>An Exercize in Finger Counting</h2>
    <p>Thanks to <a href="https://seximal.net">jan Misali</a>'s terminology, saying two base six digits could never be easier!</p>
    <p>0-20 (0-12 in decimal) all have their normal names.</p>
    <p>2X is "dozen-x." This terminology makes sense because it does.</p>
    <p>3X is thirsy-x, 4X is foursy-x, and 5X is fifsy-x. Then, 100 (36 in decimal) is "nif." Nif is borrowed from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ndom_language">Ndom language</a>.</p>
