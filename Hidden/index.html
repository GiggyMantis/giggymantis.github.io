    <h5 id="decimal">Decimal</h5>
    <p>The decimal number system, also known as <strong>base ten,</strong> is a place value system based on the number 10.</p>
    <p>Since you're reading this in English, it's very statistically likely that you use this system regularly.</p>
    <p>In this system, each place has 10 times the value of the place before it. (Y'know, "hundreds," "thousands," "units")</p>
