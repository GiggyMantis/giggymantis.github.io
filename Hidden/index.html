    <p>Since you're reading this in English, it's very statistically likely that you use this system regularly.</p>
    <p>In this system, each place has 10 times the value of the place before it. (Y'know, "hundreds," "thousands," "units")</p>

    <h5 id="seximal">Seximal</h5>
    <p>Usually called senary, the seximal system is based on the number six.</p>

    <p>The name "seximal" was coined by jan Misali.</p>
